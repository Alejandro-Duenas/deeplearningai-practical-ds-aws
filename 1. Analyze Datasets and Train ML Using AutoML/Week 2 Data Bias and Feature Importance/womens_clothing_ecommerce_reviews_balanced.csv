-1,I know we've gotten to the point that polyester can be acceptable  but sometimes it's still that horrible texture  unbreathable mess. unfortunately  that's what this top is made out of. so it runs big  its billowy  and cute  but i couldn't get it off quick enough because of the feel of the fabric.,Blouses
-1,I am very disappointed with this order. the shirt looks and feels cheap  is not flattering in any way. i am sending it back right away.,Blouses
-1,The material is so thin and so itchy..like other reviewers stated..it itches so bad and feels like sandpaper..i thought it would be ok to wear a tank top underneath but sleeves are still itchy. otherwise the design is great and the long peplum hem is very pretty and would look great with skinny pants or leggings and boots,Blouses
-1,As someone with a large chest and a smaller waist  i found this top incredibly unflattering (and i like swingy tops). it was too short  too wide in the hips  and too tight in the bust. the pattern and fabric are very pretty though.,Blouses
-1,This item is huge. i'm normally a medium  sized down to a small  still massive. couldn't go too much smaller because the buttons would pull at the chest. but the sleeves are very wide  as is the waist. way too much fabric. i had high hopes for this one but it just doesn't work. for reference i love billowy and flowy tops  but this was a tent.,Blouses
-1,Whatever happened to sizing! pretty print and color but has enough fabric for 2 tops. it is also unlined which is not a huge issue. i wore it with a cami. the arms weren't too gaping for me  thankfully. i tried to make it work with a wide belt but i will have to get it tucked on the sides. i am 140 lbs and got the small. should have gone 1 or even 2 sizes smaller.,Blouses
-1,After reading the reviews i sized down to a 6. once i received it  i loved the fabric and color  however it was so ill-fitting. it's like the designer didn't even use female measurements and used a box to make this top--too wide. i liked it so much that i sized way down to a 0 and it still fit horribly. it is too wide and not long enough. both are going back!,Blouses
-1,I read the previous reviews and ordered down a size knowing that the shirt runs big.   i really wanted to love the shirt however it was a tent. with all of the extra material in the back  it billowed out in all the wrong places. the material is comfy and it's a very cute concept  just didn't work for me.,Blouses
-1,I have never written a review before  and i love retailer and shop here often. however  i am so unhappy with this shirt i wanted to share to save someone else money. it is such poor quality  it looks thick and flows in the photo  it is very thin and it itches so bad  i could hardly even stand to try it on when it came in the mail. i will deff be taking it back  and do not recommend it at all.,Blouses
0,"I loved this top in the blue and wanted so badly for it to fit however it was very unflattering on my 5'7"" frame. the bottom hemline is straight across all around whereas i thought it was longer in the back. i could see this looking great on a really petite frame. runs large  xs fit however wasn't flattering",Blouses
0,Very cute top and nice material  but the fit is strange. there's a reason that the model has her arms at her side. the shoulders fit perfectly in my usual small  but the body is very loose. the sleeves are full  probably twice as full as seen in the pictures which adds interest but was unexpected. also  the arm hole is wide  so the bottom seam of the sleeve attaches low on the body of the shirt  which creates an awkward silhouette. i normally love designs by whit  but i'm not sure about this one,Blouses
0,I also wanted to love this top but sadly had to return it because it is very short and the peplum piece is very wide. it was not flattering at all.,Blouses
0,Please be awate that although this blouse is beautiful and the color is gorgeous--it is completely sheer!!! it just doesn't match up with the price point ,Blouses
0,"I bought this online in my usual size (petite xxs) for in-store pickup. when i tried it on  the kindest word to describe it would be ""voluminous""--it was at least 2 sizes too big on me. i looked like i had taken grandma's tablecloth and constructed a homemade blouse. the blouse comes with an attached cami  which was also way too big for me. the color is not white (as described)  but rather an ivory/cream color--definitely not the best shade for my light olive skin. i do think that it looks lovel",Blouses
0,Frumpy is the word i would use to describe this top. i look good in empire waist shirts and seek them out. but this one made me look pregnant and frumpy. and it has an attached camisole  but the sheerness of the top still showed my nude-colored bra strap. so i don't even know what to wear under it. it's going back  even with the sale price.,Blouses
0,I'm a pretty solid 10/12 in this brand. i went with the 12 since some thought the top to run small...and i agree. while i can wear it and think it will actually stretch out with wear  it's tight in the shoulders and chest. for the record  those are 2 areas i never have problems with. i'm a 36b and it was flattening my chest. it was also quite short on me. i have a short torso and it was barely hitting below my belly button. the shirt felt more like a size 8 than 12.,Blouses
0,The top is really cute  but it's see through and the material doesn't seem like the highest quality. definitely not worth the price.,Blouses
0,"This tunic is simple and well made. it was not as long as on the model as on me but i am 5'-9"".",Blouses
1,Size down! i love this item. it goes perfect with leggings but if you are typically a small you would need to order an extra small and so forth. hopefully once i wash this it will shrink some.,Blouses
1,Cute top. definitely sheer so need an undershirt. really love details on it  especially back and fringe at bottom. 5'4  135 lbs  ordered s.,Blouses
1,This is a truly exquisite top. it looks exactly as it does online with cascades of delicately embroidered flowers on front and back and a slightly ruffled neck. very chic and versatile with skirts or pants.  material is very light and chiffon like and it's fully lined so no need for a cami. it's ever so slightly see-through in the sections that are not embroidered but only in very intense light.  it fits tts  i usually get petite sizes but i got a xxs regular because i wanted a longer length and,Blouses
1,The heart version is very pretty  i can't speak for the striped one as i have not seen that one in person. i ordered the xxs after trying on the xs  as i felt the petite would be perhaps too short. the xs was a little big on me. the only problem with xxs regular is the sleeves are longer on me  like 3/4 length  not to elbow as shown on model. but i don't want the shirt to be too short so sticking with that size.    for reference  i am 115 lbs  30dd chest  26.5 in waist  and short.,Blouses
1,I knew i needed to have this shirt as soon as i saw it and luckily for me  it was already on sale. i read the other reviews and ordered a s (usually order xs or s  but went with s for this one because i was worried about the fit of the bust). overall the shirt is huge on me. i considered returning for an xs but suspect that would also be too big and maybe too short. i decided i could get it tailored instead for the cost of exchange shipping. so i will be doing that. otherwise i love everything a,Blouses
1,"I am a solid size 6 in most brands  top and bottom  5'3"" tall  125#. i have long legs  short torso  and fairly broad shoulders - i almost never wear petite sizes.however  this top in the regular small size could be a maternity dress on me! i am literally swimming in it  and it is quite long. however  i can still make it work  with a cami underneath and leggings or skinny jeans... i like it  did not return  and will buy another color  but will go with petite x-small in the future.",Blouses
1,These colors!!!  my cup of tea!  i love everything about this top  from the fit  to the raw edge of the neck trim. it does seem like it will wrinkle easily but i can manage that for its sheer beauty!,Blouses
1,I am very petite  however  fuller on top (34ddd). this top looks fabulous! it is cut in such a way that every part of your body looks slimmer. goes with jeans  dress pants of skirt. i highly recommend.,Blouses
1,Very cute top. does require a strapless bra as the straps are further out than most tops  and they also tend to fall down. also  while the top fit well  the top button gaps are far apart and tended to separate to show my chest. easy fix with a snap sewed in.,Blouses
-1,I purchased this in-store in a vivid red color  but didn't try it on until i got home. big mistake! literally the first time i tried to zip the dress  the cheap  horrible zipper noted in previous reviews just...broke. midway up  right under the waist tie. i was trapped in the dress for a good 15 minutes and was scared i'd have to rip or cut the fabric to get out of it; eventually i pulled the zipper apart to escape. can't wait to return this asap.,Dresses
-1,I returned this dress because the material is so flimsy and thin. i was expecting higher quality  especially for the price. i was disappointed. it is a pretty dress and fit great  but i felt like i was wearing tissue paper.,Dresses
-1,Great fabric and color but fits like a potato sack -- so sad bc i would have loved it,Dresses
-1,I wore this for the first time today  and after just about an hour  it gently nicked something and got a hole in the pack.  its so disappointing as i love they style and its so comfortable. very poor quality for the price :(,Dresses
-1,I ordered this dress online. the previous reviews were accurate that it runs small  particularly in the waist. i normally wear a 0 or 2  but i ordered the 4. it fit my waist and hips but was slightly loose at the top even though i am a 34c. i liked the look  but it had a hole where the seams had come apart between the black stripe across the chest and the main fabric. additionally  the black squares were pulled in several places with threads sticking out. i returned it immediately.,Dresses
-1,And this one proved to be no different. the short end of it; this dress is pretty much super thick  heavy linen with a rope like collar (the supposed embroidery you see)  and there is no lining  but completely unnecessary pockets. i'm typically a 2 or 4 depending on the designer (5'7 & a super fit 135 lbs) and knew enough to order an xs in this  however it still fit like a potato sack. even upon taking it out of the plastic bag  i knew it was going back. between the unrealistic pictures and lack,Dresses
-1,This is a cute dress  but not for me. 1. i think it runs very small  2. it is super textured so if you don't want to add bulk (aka pounds) to your frame  this probably isn't for you. it's too bad it's online only because i would have benefitted from trying this on first. i'm sure it's probably adorable on smaller  thinner people. unfortunately  mine is going back.,Dresses
-1,I really wanted to love this dress. i love the colors and the design of the dress. unfortunately  i have to agree with one of the other reviewers that this dress makes you look pregnant. it's so voluminous that it's not flattering at all. also agree that the lining is scratchy.,Dresses
-1,"I was so excited for this dress.. but sadly it did not meet expectations. the gauze fabric already had several snags/pullers in it. the underslip was very short and just cleared my derriere.(i'm 5'7"") i normally take a 10/12 and ordered this in a l.. it was somewhat clingy in the hip area but yet bulky on top. also  i like to have the first button open  but you could then see the v neck of the underslip and it looked hokey. it's definitely a thicker material than the previous plaid tunic holding",Dresses
0,I am a 10/12 and ordered the m/l. it's very large! i normally take a large in retailer  but i can't figure out my size in this. it's very wide. i love the denim patchwork detail so i will order the s/m and see how it is.,Dresses
0,I love  love  love byron lars dresses. they fit my curves like a glove. but this one... i guess it would have fit me like a glove. but i live alone  and at the moment i don't have enough money to hire a lady's maid  and so i couldn't actually tell. it buttons all the way up the back  so you cannot put it on yourself  unless you are a contortionist. wanted to love this but can't.,Dresses
0,"Agree with other reviewers: this runs narrow in the skirt. the top is also quite low-cut  and it's already lined so i can't see wearing a cami or slip. i like the black-and-white print and the shape  and might have tried a size larger in the store. finally  it's an awkward  unflattering length. i'm 5'4"" and it hit below my knee.",Dresses
0,"I ordered the geometric  blue/red pattern in a small regular. the material was soft and comfortable. it is a stand-out piece but unfortunately  it made my stomach look like it was sticking out too much. the neck line did not stay flat against my chest which resulted in an ill-fitting  bunched up look. i returned this one. for reference  i'm 5'4"" 120lbs 34 a.",Dresses
0,I was really hoping this dress would work out  as it looks like it could be a staple outfit for work! the material is very nice  but unfortunately the dress was way too big. there is a band right under the chest that i would think should be somewhat fitted to give the dress some shape to your figure  but it was wayyy to big on me (especially considering i am large-chested! i will be returning this.,Dresses
0,This dress pattern and material are great - it's just way too big. i even tried an xs and it looked like a huge sack on me. too bad  it had some real potential.,Dresses
0,"I just think this dress is so cute! i love it with booties!   here are the fit details: i'm 5'4 1/2"" and the front of the dress hits just above my knees. (i was concerned that it would be too short for my lifestyle based on the photo). the sleeves roll up and have a tab to button  however the button is very low. therefore  the sleeve rolls up not mid arm  but actually about three inches above my wrist!

0,This is a lovely  well-made piece by maeve  a longtime favorite of mine. the material is great weight and won't wrinkle  colors are vibrant  and design of the dress is cute  if a bit on the short side.    however  i  like some of the other reviewers  didn't love this this on me. the waist hit slightly above my natural waist (and i'm very short-waisted) and this particular sweetheart neckline did nothing to flatter my bust (i'm a 34dd for reference). the end result was a bit too dowdy on top with,Dresses

1,"I really like this dress. despite the somewhat gathered skirt  it has a clean line and doesn't add a lot of volume around the hips. the blue is a great color. the length is well above the knee but i'm 5'10"". i can see wearing this dress in the fall with leggings or tights and boots.",Dresses
1,"So i got this on sale and the only size they had was a xs petite. i didn't have my hopes very high but i thought i would give it a shot. the dress came today and it fit great. i am 5""6"" so the petite came just above my knees but the dress is still adorable. the material and cut is great. this is not what i was looking for but it is a welcome addition.",Dresses
1,"I have been eyeing this dress online for a while but never could justify the price. well  when it went on sale  i couldn't pass up the opportunity. it arrived today and is even better than i expected. very flattering cut  long enough for tall people (i'm 5'10"") and beautiful colors.     i ordered s (my usual size in retailer dresses  i'm 145 lbs  36c) and it fits perfectly. this will definitely be my go-to dress for the rest of the summer. i love all my retailer dresses but sometimes find them a tad",Dresses

1,This is a beautiful piece. the fabric is a nice weight and the cut of the lace across the shoulders is flattering. the sleeves are dramatic  but not overly fussy. sadly i returned the dress because although it is a swing style (no waistline)  it has a very straight cut. i was hoping it was more of an a-line silhouette to accommodate my hips  but alas. if you self-identify as a pear  this may not be the dress for you.,Dresses
1,I ordered the 00 p after trying on the regular 0  and that was better. it runs wide  the lining is true to size  but the overlay is loose. the colors are pretty  the design is nice  but i didn't love it as much as other ones.    likes: the studs add an edgier look to a almost dainty look (flow y sheer fabric). the cut is flattering if you get the right size (recommend one size down).    no big dislikes...why i would still recommend.    115 lbs  30dd chest  26.5 in waist... 00p,Dresses

-1,I was sooo excited to buy this top and it was such a bummer. this top hangs so poorly and is so droopy under the arms. it's clearly poorly made and the sizing was way off on me. i ordered my usual medium and it was so large and wide that i had to return it. it weirdly fit perfectly in the shoulders and arm length as mediums do for me but was so wide and unflattering for my figure (5'8 and athletic). i really wanted to like this top and considered ordering a small to see if it would fit better bu,Fine gauge

0,This is a relatively cute top when you try it on. however  i don't think it will hold it's shape after even just 1 wear. it also doesn't seem like you could wash it without ruining it (like a shirt form a 'throw-away' cheap clothing store). i checked the fabric tag and it is a very high % viscose - meaning  it won't last long at all. i'm returning and feel frustrated with how cheap the fabric is.,Fine gauge
0,Unfortunately this piece has a very boxy cut and the white layer is stiff and billows out - i am tall and thin but this made me look pregnant - very unflattering. i considered trying a smaller size  but i did not like the material too much either so i just returned it.,Fine gauge
0,I am returning. i really liked the appearance in the photo and i love aqua  but the biggest problem for me is the shape. it's pretty boxy and it's hard to tell from the photo  but it has a batwing shape. i also wish the lighter portion were more ivory (less yellow in it)  but that's based on what looks better against my skin tone. i found it to run true to size  but i thought it was unflattering (made me look wide).,Fine gauge

1,Saw the grey one on the table at my local retailer. first thing i did was touch it to feel if it's soft and it felt like butta. surprisingly  it's a very snuggly and warm sweater despite it not being very thick. i think the grey is conservative enough for the office and it goes with pretty much everything  yet the geometric shapes make it modern and interesting looking. i hate turtleneck (choke!) and big cowl neck (reminds me of the 80's)  but this is a compromise of both which is a bonus. since i,Fine gauge
1,This sweater is very warm yet light. the pink color is very cute  and the buttons are detailed very nicely! it hangs a bit low under the arms  and definitely tightens at the wrist. i ordered the xs size  and i find that i am unable to push the sleeves up. this is so beautiful and has a subtle uniqueness.,Fine gauge

1,Great design & execution - this is essentially a striped jersey sleeveless turtleneck  made of a nice  high-quality jersey. with a delicate lightweight soft sweater attached over it. so you get this really pretty look where the jersey underlay means the sweater hangs beautifully  no clinging at all. and the sleeves are just the sheer sweater - so pretty.  i got the lavender - looks exactly like the pic. and it is true to size.,Fine gauge

0,This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one,Intimates
0,"The fit is gorgeous  but i didn't realize it was completely transparent. when it says ""mesh"" it means ""mesh""! i was thinking the ""mesh"" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut  high on the shoulders  you can't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute  but not practical.",Intimates
0,If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing  but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day.,Intimates
0,It is a very pretty bra. light weight and beautiful lace. however  i have yet to find a t-back that does not make me feel like i am going to spill out. to me it ran small. i now know to get a 34 instead. i am working on losing weight  perhaps that might help with the fit?,Intimates
0,I ordered this in black and white  thinking you can never have enough silk camisoles.     i returned the black because it looked like polyester. the white is actually a cream/ivory  not bright white as pictured. it is also not the best feeling quality  however the fit is good  and true to size.,Intimates
0,I love and live in these but the recent scoop tanks i purchased were thin  not as great. so i want to recommend them because they are really versatile but the quality has deminished.,Intimates
0,I wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors  but after only a few minutes of wearing them  i was having to pull them out of my bottom! why does women's underwear so frequently ride up? i normally wear a size 4/28  and ordered these in a m  but i guess they were still too small  which seems unreasonable to me. they are soft and pretty  but i will not be ordering more.,Intimates
0,I have been eyeing this piece for months now! i broke down and bought it when they finally had my size in stock. i am 5 '4 and 110 lbs and have a very small chest so i ordered an xs. i think the top is too baggy for me. yes  the top and bottoms fit overall  but it doesn't look as nice and form fitting like it does on the model. it is very sheer--which is the thing that discourages me the most. i love the concept of this piece but the execution could use some work  which i am willing to work on s,Intimates
1,I am not a fan of unlined bras  but this one was so pretty i had to try it. the lace doesn't look cheap  but overall i wouldn't have wanted to pay full price. it fits well and the support offers a nice shape (no cone!). i might go back for the other color.,Intimates
1,This bra is very cute and pretty comfortable. i usually wear between a 34d in elle mcpherson and this fit perfect. i got it in black and while it's really cute i was surprised how different the color looked in person vs. online. online it looked to me to have some purple to it  but it is definitely 100% black in person (just an fyi). i also thought the tassel was cute  but it does look a little cheap and flimsy in person. still a great bra.,Intimates
1,This is different from any bra i've had before  in a good way. the lace over the front is really beautiful  and no annoying straps means it's comfortable! fit and support are both great. i didn't notice that it was silk when i ordered  so it was a nice surprise to open something so luxe and elegant. i wasn't expecting an underwire  either  based on the s-m-l sizing  but it has one.,Intimates
1,This is my first time purchasing a bra from this brand and i am in love. the style and quality are amazing. it is the most comfortable bra i owned to date and i will be buying more from this line. it provides a lift without all of the uncomfortable padding which requires continuous adjusting. i am saying goodbye to vs forever. i got this in red and the bra looks more expensive than it actually is and the fit is simply amazing.it is sexy and classic at the same time.,Intimates

1,Looks exactly as it does in the pictures. very comfortable  loose flowing  and has a slip underneath it. i'm personally a little hesitant to buy clothes online because it's always a guessing game when it comes to figuring out what size. with that  i have wide hips/big thighs so i tend to vary between medium and large  but thankfully the medium fits like a glove!,Intimates

0,Very pretty but runs tight - i usually wear an 8 or small/med in retailer jackets and couldn't zip up the 8 (am a 36c and thick/broad at the top) as there is no give. this is also more like a fitted shirt  made of lightweight muslin-like fabric. was looking for a summer jacket to wear over knits in a chilly  air conditioned office setting so sadly it didn't work for me. could be cute on someone with a smaller frame over a tank or cami.,Jackets
0,I saw this jacket and loved the plaid and the idea of a soft sherpa material as a lining was hard to pass up1it was true to size and the material was very nice. however  the button closure was difficult as the buttonholes seemed a bit too small. also  the back of the jacket did not lay flat and it kept rolling.... i had to return this jacket.,Jackets
0,I'm normally a 10/12 and ordered the m/l. the body was a little big but ok. the arms are really wide. there are snaps to make them tighter but it doesn't do much. i do like the embroidery. it's an ok jacket but the fit could have been better.,Jackets
0,Slouchy relaxed fit. well sewn together and hangs well on the body. bottom hem hits upper thigh. good length and soft  easy fabric. light layering option as well. good spring jacket  can be kept on indoors without getting too hot.,Jackets

0,This design looks really sharp on the image  but in reality this jacket felt more like a jacket you would get at forever xxi.  the fabric had that polyester/shiny quality to it that made it look cheap.  since the fabric was pretty soft  with a gray jersey lining  it felt more like a padded jacket than a constructed blazer.      i also thought the cut was small if you have a bust larger than a b  i felt like i was busting out of a size 8  and i am a 34d.,Jackets

1,I love the design of this cape. most capes are coats which can only be wore in the fall months here in the midwest since winter is too cold. this cape is more like a layering piece for indoors similar to a cardigan sweater  which i like. it can be wore in an office setting or out on the town with jeans. the constructions is well made as well,Jackets

1,Love love love. i tried it on a whim when returning a shipped item. it's gorgeous and incredibly flattering. runs large (it's drapey and would likely look good in your normal size since you can synch the waist  but probably best to size down as it seemed large in the bust size - which isn't an issue i usually run into).     it's quickly become a great staple for work. definitely pair it with bodycon pants/ leggings/ skinny jeans - and it looks unique and very professional.,Jackets

1,This is a very loose fitting style jacket. if you like your jackets oversized  get your regular size. if you prefer the slightly loose (but not baggy) fit like the product photo  size down. as noted by another reviewer  the sleeves are incredibly long. i would say if you are a typical size 0 or 2 (unless you like the oversized fit)  you are likely sized out of this jacket. it's a shame  because the quality is great and the windowpane print is beautiful. i'm sadly sized out.,Jackets

-1,I was excited to see these jeans since they came in petite sizes and had a short inseam... unfortunately after ordering/returning several pairs  i found out that these are actually not petite jeans. please beware that if you are ordering these for the shorter inseam  they are actually 28 in... not 24 in as in the description. other than the inseam issues  they fit like typical paige denim.,Jeans

-1,I had such high hopes  but they are just slightly off. they run a tad large  so i suggest sizing down. (i usually wear a 28 or 29  and the 28 fit nicely through the hips and thighs.)  unfortunately  the color is off- i thought they were going to be a dark midnight blue  but they are actually gray. and they have a button-fly closure which causes the pants to protrude a bit in the area where no woman wants protrusion. i will be returning them.,Jeans

1,I love this top- it's loose and flowy  yet flattering  and the colors are fun. the armholes are cut a little low  so a cami is necessary. after one wash and lay flat dry  the wrinkling is substantial. hope i can steam it back to its normal shape.,Knits
-1,Way too long...the sizing is incredibly off on this product. order a size or two down.,Layering
-1,This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however  like a previous reviewer  the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can't see in the photos due to the model's cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted  without all the excess fabric at the bottom  it would have been perfect. again  the color  the lace  the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came,Layering
-1,The material is very nice. not flimsy at all which is nice. the problem was the fit around the arms. i am a petite person with a small chest but it still didn't cover me bra. i'll be returning it.,Layering
-1,This top fit perfectly but too much of my bra was showing through the black lace. it would be a great top to use as loungewear  though.,Layering
-1,Doesn't feel like cotton jersey. feels like a thin version of the seamless cami. it's not soft as i expected. it's much thinner than expected too.,Layering
-1,I wore this bodysuit once. it had a hole under the arm when i took it off,Layering
-1,Wow! this sure is close fitting  as in suction cups to your body! yikes  definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves. to me  it seems like the material will wear well. i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it  not sure. it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs  it won't work. i ordered the medium and am usually a small. the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy. i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas.,Layering
-1,Very poorly made- wide and short  very unflattering. the material is advertised as cotton  but it felt very synthetic.,Layering
-1,"This shirt fits very closely to the body. it has a very strange fit in the shoulder  though. the arms themselves are really long  far past my hands  yet it's very tight in the shoulder and under arm area. for reference  i am 5'10""  130 pounds and ordered a small  which is what i usually need.",Layering
0,I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body  but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes.,Layering
0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering
0,I love the wide straps but it runs small and is short. still great for layering. great  soft material. i hate that it is so tight and short but if i size up them the arm holes would be way too big.,Layering
0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",Layering
0,"I like this shirt  as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts. however  after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans. so: good if you don't like long t-shirts  bad if you are tall  like me (5'8"") and don't want to wear a crop top.",Layering
0,I love the way the mock neck style looks  but the shirt is cut very small. i realize it's supposed to stretch  but it's still very  very tight on  particularly in the shoulder area. if you like the style  i'd recommend sizing up.,Layering
0,So comfortable and soft but starting pilling after one wear! sending back.,Layering
0,I was looking for an undergarment and this is more of a nightgown. if it came in a solid color then i'd probably buy it. i usually wear a small and this was a tad too tight. on the upside  the fabric was soft and lightweight.,Layering
0,This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.,Layering
1,There's something special about this tank that makes it uber-flattering. the fabric is perfect  the colors (green and fuchsia) are spot-on gorgeous and brightening  and the cut (length  wide straps  and scooped neckline) make this the perfect staple. it flattered my figure  skin color  and really hid my flaws. i wish i could get away with wearing this every day...,Layering
1,"Looking for the perfect camisole that smooths the flab  keeps you warm or cool as appropriate  doesn't ride up  and looks good? this is it! it takes a bit of extra effort to get this cami over your head and pulled down  but once you do  you say ""ahhh!"" it feels good and is a blessing--a seamless bit of control of middle-age  middle-body flab. for sizing: i wear a size 4 in most clothes  and in this cami  i can wear a small/medium or a medium/large. the former pulls in more  but the later gives m",Layering
1,Love this top! i'm 5'7  145 pounds  athletic build  and the medium falls slightly loosely and very nicely over my hips. it is quite low cut  so i wear a tank under it in a professional environment  but it's fine to wear sans tank top in a more casual setting. i really love the back  as the straps are sexy and show off my shoulders. the material seems to be good quality  and i would order this in more colors if it were available!,Layering
1,This is great  lightweight top layer that's just right for the little evening chill in the summer when the sun goes down  or on a breezy day. it's sheer  so it requires a bottom layer. the medium fits a little tighter across the shoulders and arms for me than it shows on the model  which i like.,Layering
1,Great tank top! loved it so much that i ordered 3!,Layering
1,These t-shirts by pure + good are buttery soft and so flattering. they are just loose enough to drape beautifully and the detailing at the neckline takes them just a step above basic tee. i have 2 from last year  machine washed many many times (on delicate cycle) and they still look almost new. i was hoping to pick up a couple more but they're gone! please retailer  bring these tees back!! i would kill for that beautiful dark blue...,Layering
1,This turtleneck is already wrapped and it's soon going under the tree for me! i bought it when i saw it in the store and tried it on. it's fitted but not too tight or snug... just fitted and flattering. the lace cutout area is so flattering and unexpected. i love this top and think it will be a wardrobe staple - both for dress and casual. (i'll wash it carefully just in case. it seems well made but i'd hate to snag the lace.),Layering
1,"I love this dress. i'm 5'8"" and it fits me exactly like the model in the picture. i have slim hips and waist  so that helps. i don't think this would be as flattering on someone curvy. i wish it came in another color i like  i would absolutely buy in another color. i got a medium and it fits like a glove.",Layering
1,I ordered the black (not yet available ) through my store  as the xs was too big  and we tried ordering xs petite but it was not yet available. so we ordered xxs.

-1,I am so sad i have to return these leggings. they're adorable--so much so that my fiancã© commented favorably on them--but as other reviewers have pointed out  there's no elastic or string in the waistband so you have to walk around holding them up with one hand or they'll fall down! why  sleeping on snow? whyyyyyyyyyyy? they're so great otherwise!,Legwear
-1,I opened these when i got them yesterday and immediately tried them on. the knees were totally stretched out and due to the panel at the knee  it looked like i had growths popping out between my legs at my knees. someone had received these before me and sent them back after they tried them on or wore them then returned them. they were obviously too small for whoever did that. these never should have been resent to another customer. they are obviously very misshapen. they are going back. on a bet,Legwear

1,I received my coat today. in love! it is so flattering in so many ways. it may not be form fitting  but i love all the details and i'm a sucker for hoods. this is a great fall/winter coat especially if you live in the south. it will probably only work as a late spring/early fall coat for you northern ladies. my only compliant is that the arms are too long  but i'm only 5'  so it'll possibly be the perfect fit for someone else.,Outerwear
1,Omg when i saw this coat in the baby blue i knew i had to have it. i tried it on and fell madly in love! i decided it was the only thing i needed in this world. it is soft and cozy. comfort with an old fashion hollywood glam. its almost sold out already  so grab it if you can cuz its divine! does run a little big  so i got a 0 instead of a 2 and its perfect.,Outerwear
1,I had my eye on this coat for so long. when i saw it was on sale and an extra 30% off i decided to go for it. i ignored the reviews that said it ran big and took a chance and sadly it did not pay off. this jacket is very heavy so if you are going to get it on sale  it will probably go into the closet for next winter. it was very boxy on me and tied at the waist  made my upper half look huge. it was just not flattering at all. the heaviness of it also made the big open neck a little annoying and,Outerwear

1,I received this jacket in an 8. fits great with room . i am a 34dd chest for reference as i was not sure if i needed a 10  but the 8 is perfect. see my pictures as i feel the website photos are more bright as the actual jacket is more muted. buttons are very nice but the pocket flaps hit right at the boob area so it my bother some . very high quality  lined and will look great over some retailer dresses in the same color way i purchased last year. depending on the season this jacket would do fine,Outerwear

-1,I wished these fit a little better. unfortunately  they were a little tight in the thighs and if i didn't pull the waist of the pants up  i had sagging crotch and the pockets hung out. needless to say i made a return.,Pants
-1,Unique print but not great execution. the pant legs are very tight  i have average sized calves and i sized up one size. the hook closure was oddly tight and difficult to clasp. when i first saw the color it looked like burnt sienna or a dried blood color. too bad this didn't work out.,Pants
-1,I thought these were gorgeous and was going to buy them although the price was a bit high. in fact  two separate women came up to me as i was walking around the store and asked where i got the pants because the colors are so vivid. however  as we were looking at the items  we noticed that both the green and the blue both had several small holes in them due to stitching quality  as the previous reviewer noted. therefore  none of us purchased the pants.    the staff at the store were very helpful,Pants
-1,I purchased these pants on 12/2/15 as a more fashionable alternative to yoga pants while traveling southeast asia starting february. after about 10-15 wears (with little washing in between as i was backpacker style traveling) the pants wore through in between my legs. the fabric first started to develop little fuzz balls everywhere and then literally disintegrated in places. i tried to sew them to continue wearing them while traveling but alas the fabric had become so thin that the thread could,Pants

-1,I would not recommend these pants if you have a curvy or athletic figure. these pants seem to be cut straight up and down. the fabric is not soft  the color is slightly more muted in person  and they are not as relaxed as they appear to be on the model.,Pants
-1,Given that i am petite with thighs (take a size 6p or 28p) these were not for me! the run small  are really tight from the thigh up  run longer that a petite should and are fairly thin. on top of that the zipper and hook in the back are really inconvenient. i was looking for something i could wear to work  and these were not the right style for that. plus they seemed cheaply made  like they wouldn't stand the test of time. i imagine if you are tall and skinny like the model  they would look good,Pants

0,I am so sad that this romper didn't work out. it's just way too billowy and huge. i am usually between a small and medium so i ordered this small. i'm petite and somewhat curvy and i was absolutely swimming in this romper! might look best on taller girls. i am 5 '2 and about 125-130 lbs and this was like wearing a tent. do not recommend. such a bummer because i was a believer after treading all of the great reviews!,Shorts

-1,I bought this in the blue and really wanted to like it--i had plans to check sizing and then order it again in the red  as well! however  this skirt falls victim to the recent design trend of using a pattern for a structured skirt but substituting a softer fabric and (horrors!) an elastic waistband. this ended up just looking kind of cheap and sweatshirty as a result. back it went.,Skirts
